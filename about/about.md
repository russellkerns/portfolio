My background as a professional classical musician taught me incredible work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to quickly comprehend and execute on the complex language that is music. I've leveraged this skillset when working on complex tasks on the job, as well as being able to navigate more ambigious tasks when given really difficult bugs to fix. I've come to enjoy working throughout the entire tech stack in Javascript, but am hungry to learn other tools I can add to my developer toolkit. I'm passionate about writing DRY, maintainable code that is thoroughly tested.
