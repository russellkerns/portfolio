My background as a professional classical musician taught me incredible work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to quickly comprehend and execute on the complex language that is music. Iâ€™ve traded out the language of music for the language of coding, but plan to apply these same strengths in my transition to a career in software engineering. The pursuit of a full-time career in the arts turned music into stress instead of a passion. When I rediscovered my affinity for code, I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. Though I will always love and perform music, I look forward to applying these skills to coding.
